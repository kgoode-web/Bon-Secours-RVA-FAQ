<program> Program Policy FAQs
<faq_three> What is the duration of the therapy program? </faq_three>
	<answer_three> Your insurance provider determines the length of the program. Typically, insurance providers, including Medicare, only pay 8 weeks for home health rehabilitation. Hence, our program is typically a 60 day program. However, your therapy team can request for extended service if they deem it necessary. Please converse with your therapy team or your insurance provider to inquire the exact amount of weeks your insurance will cover. </answer_three>
<faq_four> How do I get extended service? </faq_four>
	<answer_four> Converse with your therapy team. If your therapy team sees a need for extended service then they will contact your primary physician to write an order for extended service. This order will be submitted to your insurance provider for review. Upon authorization, you will be notified by your care team when the service has been extended. Extended service is subjected to renewal every 2 to 3 years depending on your insurance provider. Some providers renewal policies varies from every 6 months to every 4 years. The best course of action is to get in touch with your therapy team and they will walk you through this process and provide you with greater details. </answer_four>

<therapy> Therapy FAQs
<faq_five> How do I schedule an appointment with my therapy team? </faq_five>
	<answer_five> Your therapy team will get in contact with you to arrange an appointment time. When you first begin Home Health, you will be contacted by all members of your therapy team to arrange an initial evaluation meeting. Based on their evaluations, they will contact you again to arrange further appointment times. </answer_five>
<faq_six> How do I get a referral for outpatient? <faq_six>
	<answer_six> Consult your therapy team about your desire to go to outpatient. Based on their assessments and recommendations, they will contact your primary physician to write an order for outpatient. Once this order has been authorized by your insurance provider you will be contacted by the outpatient rehabilitation center of your choice to schedule a start time. For patients who are uninsured, it is the same process. Your therapy team will contact your physician and an order will be written. However, you will not have to wait for authorization from an insurance company. You can arrange payment with the outpatient rehabilitation center on your own terms. </answer_six>
<faq_seven> How do I issue a complaint about my therapy team? </faq_seven>
